# Marketing Plan and Commercial Strategy
**Objective:** Define market positioning, commercial approach, pricing strategy, and customer acquisition methods for FastTriage.

## Marketing Plan

### Value Proposition
FastTriage automates part of the hospital screening process, reducing bottlenecks in emergency care and improving patient flow. By converting patient responses into structured clinical reports, the system decreases the workload of healthcare professionals, supports faster prioritization of critical cases, and improves the patient experience through a faster and more organized initial interaction.

### Market Positioning
FastTriage is positioned primarily as an operational efficiency solution for hospitals. Its focus is to reduce screening time, organize preliminary clinical information with higher quality, and optimize medical decision-making.
The core benefits are:

1. Reduced screening time and faster patient flow
2. Structured clinical reports that improve prioritization and treatment
3. Improved patient experience during emergency care

The solution operates as a support tool for nurses and physicians, not as a diagnostic or medical decision system.

### Comparative Advantages
To illustrate the operational impact of the solution, the table below compares key aspects of the current screening model versus screening supported by FastTriage:

| Aspect | Current Manual Screening | Screening with FastTriage |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Data collection | Conducted manually by nurses | Automated via WhatsApp |
| Time required | Dependent on staff availability | Can occur before patient arrival or while waiting |
| Information format | Notes taken manually | Structured clinical report |
| Human workload | High demand on nursing staff | Reduced workload during initial screening |
| Patient experience | Long waiting time | Faster initial interaction |
| Prioritization | Based on manual clinical judgment | Structured symptoms help highlight critical cases |

### Customer Acquisition and Distribution Channels
Initial commercial actions will focus on direct contact with hospital decision-makers, including medical directors, emergency care coordinators, and IT management teams. To strengthen market visibility, the strategy includes:

- Participation in healthcare and health-tech events
- Demonstrations and technical presentations to hospitals
- Academic legitimacy through validation with healthcare professionals
- Potential future integration with hospital management platforms (e.g., MV, Tasy)

FastTriage is delivered as a web-based solution for hospitals, while patients interact through WhatsApp, simplifying adoption without requiring a dedicated mobile app.

## Commercial Strategy

### Market Entry Strategy
The entry strategy prioritizes a **pilot phase** in one or more hospitals. This stage aims to validate usability, measure the reduction of screening time, and collect structured feedback from nurses and physicians. The pilot will also generate practical evidence and metrics to support future commercial negotiations.

### Pricing Strategy
The pricing model will follow a phased approach:

**1. Pilot Phase (initial stage)**
To lower adoption barriers, FastTriage will offer a pilot period with reduced or waived cost. This allows hospitals to test the platform, validate usability, and measure operational impact before committing to a full contract.

**2. Commercial Phase (post-pilot)**
After validation, the pricing model combines two components:

- **Implementation and configuration fee**
  Covers setup, onboarding, adaptation of screening forms, and alignment with hospital processes.

- **Monthly license + usage-based billing**
  Hospitals pay a fixed monthly fee for system access, plus a variable cost per screening processed.
  This keeps pricing proportional to real usage, making the solution accessible for hospitals of different sizes and workloads.

The table below compares viable pricing models:

| Pricing Model | Advantages | Disadvantages | Suitability for FastTriage |
|---------------|------------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Monthly fixed license | Predictable revenue, simple for clients | High-risk without usage metrics | Suitable only after product maturity |
| Usage-based billing | Costs aligned with real volume, scalable | Higher financial variability | Works for hospitals with fluctuating demand |
| Implementation + monthly license + variable usage | Covers setup cost and scales with usage | Requires usage monitoring | **Ideal post-pilot model** |
| Free or subsidized pilot | Eases adoption and generates real data | No immediate revenue | **Ideal for entry and validation stage** |

### Customer Relationship and Support
During the pilot stage, the team will provide onboarding, training, and continuous monitoring. Feedback from healthcare professionals will guide improvements and future releases.

In later stages, support evolves into:
- Training and documentation
- Periodic updates
- On-demand technical assistance
