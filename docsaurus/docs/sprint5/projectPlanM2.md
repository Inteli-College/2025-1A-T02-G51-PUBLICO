## Executive Summary

An application that allows patients to perform hospital triage remotely, directing them to the most appropriate facility in the hospital network for their care. The solution aims to reduce the number of unnecessary trips to healthcare centers and avoid redundant triages in different units of the network.

---

## Problem Statement

The proposed solution seeks to address the high number of trips made by patients to hospital centers, as well as the repetition of triages for the same health issue of the same patient.

Frequently, for example, a patient is seen at an outpatient clinic, goes through an initial triage, and is then referred to another specific hospital, where they need to travel again and undergo a new triage upon arrival — often on different days or weeks — which further delays the start of treatment.

---

## Business Description

The system proposes the automation of the initial hospital triage stage, with the goal of reducing the number of repeated triages and prior visits to medical care. The solution will be made available through a mobile app or chatbot via WhatsApp, making it easier for the patient to access the service.

Using a large language model (LLM), the system interacts directly with the patient, starting with general questions and, based on the responses provided, conducting more specific questions focused on the main clinical suspicions.

With the information collected, the system is able to classify the severity of the condition and direct the patient to the most appropriate hospital for their care.

> **Important:** The system **does not provide diagnoses or offer treatments**. Its role is to generate a detailed report that will serve as a basis for the physician to understand the patient's clinical scenario, as well as guide the patient more efficiently within the hospital network.

## Business Objectives

The project is configured as an innovative technological solution aimed at the healthcare sector, with the objective of optimizing the hospital triage process through artificial intelligence.

The proposal is to offer an initial automated service to the patient, accessible via mobile app or WhatsApp chatbot, reducing the number of repeated triages, speeding up proper referrals, and promoting greater efficiency in hospital care.

Although it operates before the patient arrives at the hospital, the solution will be integrated into the hospital network systems, enabling healthcare professionals to access the report generated during the remote triage. This contributes to a more effective organization of medical demand and to the continuity of care based on the information already collected.

### Main Objectives:

- Develop an accessible and intuitive interface for patients of different profiles, prioritizing practicality and clear language — which can be via mobile app or through the implementation of a WhatsApp chatbot, increasing the solution's reach and contributing to its democratization, especially among people with low familiarity with digital technologies;
- Ensure data security, privacy, and confidentiality, in compliance with medical information protection regulations (such as the LGPD);
- Create a dynamic flow of questions, based on a large language model (LLM), capable of adapting to the patient’s answers and offering personalized triage;
- Generate a detailed clinical report to assist healthcare professionals in the care process, without providing diagnoses or prescriptions;
- Facilitate integration with hospital systems, ensuring that the collected information is used effectively in in-person care.
