# Triage Overview

Triage has evolved over time to meet the needs of different healthcare fields, resulting in various models adapted to each scenario:

**Hospital Triage**: Occurs in hospitals and emergency rooms, prioritizing patients based on urgency to optimize resources and professionals' time.

**Clinical Triage**: Assesses the patient's overall health, which may include preventive exams and the selection of organ, bone marrow, and blood donors.

**Psychological Triage**: Analyzes patients seeking psychological or psychiatric care, identifying symptoms, causes, and the best treatment approach.

**Ambulatory Triage**: Applied in low-complexity care, organizing consultations and directing patients to the appropriate professionals.

## Project Focus: Hospital Triage

The primary goal of triage is to prioritize patient care based on the severity of their condition, ensuring that the most urgent cases receive treatment first.

### Frequently Asked Questions and Key Information Collected in Current Hospital Triage

Hospital triage is currently conducted through manual interaction between a pharmacist and the patient.

### Personal Information and Identification
Both personal data, such as name, CPF (Brazilian ID number), etc., and health insurance details, including a registration number. With the registration number, other data could be retrieved from the patientâ€™s account.
*(Idea: The first input field should be the registration number, and personal data should be retrieved and displayed automatically.)*
