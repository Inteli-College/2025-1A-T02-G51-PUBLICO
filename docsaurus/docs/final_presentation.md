# Final Presentation

Below you can view the embedded slides for my thesis final presentation:

<iframe
  src="../static/fastTriage_apresentação_final.pdf"
  style={{
    border: "none",
    width: "100%",
    height: "480px",
  }}
  loading="lazy"
  allowFullScreen
/>

## How this embed works

To embed Canva slides in Docusaurus:

1. In **Canva**, open your presentation and click **Share → More → Embed**.
2. Copy the **embed link** (or the `<iframe>` code).
3. In a Docusaurus `.mdx` file, add an `<iframe>` like above and paste your URL in `src`.
4. Adjust `width` and `height` in the `style` object if needed.
