# Summary of reasons for not delivering the semester deliverables

**1) WhatsApp API (Meta/Facebook) integration was more complex than anticipated**

* **What happened:** The integration required additional technical and bureaucratic steps (configuration, verification, and approvals), creating waiting periods that paused development.
* **Impact:** Delays in critical features and repeated sprint replanning.
* **Corrective action:** Use a simpler intermediary provider (e.g., **Twilio**) to accelerate go-to-market while keeping the direct Meta integration on a parallel, mid-term track.

**2) Lack of agile process tracking and unclear final deadlines for deliverables**

* **What happened:** There was no consistent monitoring routine (e.g., weekly progress review), and final deadlines for deliverables were not clearly defined or justified by estimates.
* **Impact:** Low predictability, difficulty in prioritization, and a higher risk of discovering delays too late.
* **Corrective action:** maintain the already exisitng **Kanban board** with **well-defined tasks** (small, with an owner) and **justifiable due dates** based on estimates and team capacity, reviewed on a fixed cadence.

**3) Under-specified scope and insufficient acceptance criteria**

* **What happened:** Clear acceptance criteria and minimal documentation were missing (concise user stories, Definition of Ready/Done).
* **Impact:** Large and vague tasks, difficulty measuring real progress, and limited risk anticipation.
* **Corrective action:** Write user stories with objective acceptance criteria, adopt **DoR/DoD**, break large items into shippable increments, and document scope decisions.

**Immediate next steps (suggestion):**

* Break critical deliverables into smaller tasks with clear acceptance criteria.
* Set **justifiable due dates** for each task and for semester milestones.
* Decide this week whether to adopt **Twilio** as a short-term messaging solution.
