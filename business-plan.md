# Business Plan – FastTriage

## Structuring and Business Foundation

### Executive Summary
FastTriage is a technological solution designed to automate a significant portion of the hospital triage process through the use of a Large Language Model (LLM). The platform interacts directly with patients via a chatbot, collecting structured clinical information through predefined general questions and dynamically adapting follow-up questions based on patient responses.

The system does not provide diagnoses or treatments. Instead, it generates a structured and detailed clinical report that supports healthcare professionals during medical assessment. By automating the initial data collection phase, FastTriage aims to reduce triage time, optimize hospital workflows, and alleviate the workload of nursing staff without replacing them.

FastTriage is positioned as a B2B SaaS solution, intended for adoption by hospitals and healthcare institutions. The platform integrates into existing hospital environments and prioritizes data security, ethical use of artificial intelligence, and compliance with healthcare data protection regulations.

### Problem Statement
Hospital triage processes are largely manual and highly dependent on nursing staff. This leads to increased waiting times, operational overload, and potential delays in patient diagnosis and prioritization. As patient volume grows and healthcare systems face increasing pressure, the current model becomes inefficient and difficult to scale.

FastTriage addresses this problem by automating the initial phase of patient information collection, enabling faster, more organized, and more consistent triage workflows.

---

### Business Description
FastTriage proposes the automation of hospital triage by combining conversational interfaces and artificial intelligence. Patients interact with the system through a chatbot, answering general questions that dynamically evolve into more specific inquiries based on their responses.

The collected data is processed by an LLM and transformed into a structured clinical report that summarizes the patient's condition. This report is then made available to healthcare professionals, offering a clear overview of the patient's situation before direct medical evaluation.

The solution is being developed with professional validation through a partnership with a physician from Hospital das Clínicas (USP), ensuring alignment with real clinical workflows, ethical considerations, and practical healthcare needs. This partnership does not represent a commercial contract, but rather a professional collaboration to guide the project toward real-world applicability.

## Market Analysis

### Industry Analysis
The healthcare sector has been undergoing rapid digital transformation, driven by increasing demand, operational inefficiencies, and advancements in artificial intelligence. Healthtech solutions focused on automation, decision support, and patient engagement have gained relevance, particularly in hospital environments where efficiency directly impacts quality of care.

Artificial intelligence, especially large language models, has shown potential to support healthcare workflows by organizing information, assisting professionals, and improving communication without replacing clinical judgment.

---

### Target Audience
The primary target audience for FastTriage consists of hospitals and healthcare institutions seeking to optimize triage workflows, reduce operational bottlenecks, and improve patient experience.

Secondary stakeholders include healthcare professionals who benefit from structured clinical information and patients who experience reduced waiting times and more organized care pathways.

---

### Competitor Analysis
At the current stage of the project, no direct competitors offering the same combination of automated triage, LLM-based interaction, and structured report generation have been identified.

Indirect competitors include:
- Manual triage processes
- Generic chatbot solutions without clinical structuring
- Hospital systems that rely solely on human-driven workflows
